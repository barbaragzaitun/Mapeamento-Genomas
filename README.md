# Mapeamento-Genomas
This repository is a step-by-step of aligning sequencing reads of Aspergillus Lentulus using Bowtie2.
## Our lab group sent us the sequenced genome of Aspergillus Lentulus so we could make a alingment with the reads.
Bowtie 2 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences.
Here, I'll report step-by-step:
### After the download and installation of Bowtie2, in Linux Shell,
